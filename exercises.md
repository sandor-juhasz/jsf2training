# JavaServer Faces Training Exercises

1. Create a "Hello World" JSF application. The application should have
   a single main page and it should display your name. Your name
   should be read from a managed bean.
   
2. Create a JSF application called "copymyname". The application
   displays an input field and a submit button. When the submit button
   is pressed the string "You have submitted: VALUE." should appear
   below the input field where VALUE is the field of the input
   field. The input field should be cleared after a submit and should
   be focused. The application should display a custom error message
   if the form is submitted with an empty value.
